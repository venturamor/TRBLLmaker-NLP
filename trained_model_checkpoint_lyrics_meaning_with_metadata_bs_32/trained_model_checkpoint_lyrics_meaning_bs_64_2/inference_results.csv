","He is talking about how he is always high but the wordplay may actually go deeper.

“Stoned ever since the days of creation” could be a historical reference to the Stone Age, one of the earliest times for mankind, named after primitive humans creating stone tools. This could tie in with the Flintstones reference from earlier.

It could also be biblical, as the “days of creation” in the Bible are the days in which God created the universe. The “been stoned” part may be a reference to John 8:7 from the Bible, which says “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her”. The verse means that you shouldn’t shame others if you aren’t perfect yourself. Phi could be referencing it to say that either he gets shunned for his drug-addicted lifestyle when it isn’t much worse than anyone else’s or it’s a reference to racism and prejudice against black communities. “I’ve been red” is a homophone for “I’ve been read” which could mean that Phi is a religious guy hence the references.

Purchasing Gucci clothing is an expensive habit, which ties back in with the theme of the song.

Ludacris spins this in two ways. Firstly, he explains that when you’re hot, and you’re relevant in the game, your money is good and your figure is good, the Gucci fits perfectly over your sculpted frame. However, when you fall off (in both a physical and metaphorical sense), your game is much less tight than it was. All of a sudden, that Gucci doesn’t physically fit, nor does it fit with your image. It becomes worthless.

He plays on the word “pockets” to mean both the pockets on your expensive clothing not working anymore, and to indicate you no longer have the bank-roll you once did.","Soon all that Gucci don’t fit, now you out of dough

Solis and Luna’s fight is a metaphorical one, though, referring to their sexually-charged interaction. “If you talk the talk, you’d better walk the walk” is an idiom meaning you have to back up your claims with actions—Solis doesn’t just say he’ll take control, he gets physical and asserts his dominance.

But “flip the script” means to reverse expectations, and Solis being willing to “take a beating” in this context means he’s not afraid to take a submissive role either.

“Stoned ever since the days of creation” could be a historical reference to the Stone Age, one of the earliest times for mankind, named after primitive humans creating stone tools. This could tie in with the Flintstones reference from earlier.

It could also be biblical, as the “days of creation” in the Bible are the days in which God created the universe. The “been stoned” part may be a reference to John 8:7 from the Bible, which says “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her”.

Phi could be referencing it to say that either he gets shunned for his drug-addicted lifestyle when it isn’t much worse than anyone else’s or it’s a reference to racism and prejudice against black communities. “I’ve been red” is a homophone for “I’ve been read” which could mean that Phi is a religious guy hence the references.

“Stoned ever since the days of creation” could be a historical reference to the Stone Age, one of the earliest times for mankind, named after primitive humans creating stone tools. This could tie in with the Flintstones reference from earlier.

It could also be biblical, as the “days of creation” in the Bible are the days in which God created the universe. The “been stoned” part may be a reference to John 8:7 from the Bible, which says “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her”.

Firstly, he explains that when you’re hot, and you’re relevant in the game, your money is good and your figure is good, the Gucci fits perfectly over your sculpted frame. However, when you fall off (in both a physical and metaphorical sense), your game is much less tight than it was. All of a sudden, that Gucci doesn’t physically fit, nor does it fit with your image.

In the literal “script” of Romeo + Juliet, Tybalt spots Romeo with Juliet and immediately wants to fight him:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JoOpx6VwHk

Solis and Luna’s fight is a metaphorical one, though, referring to their sexually-charged interaction. “If you talk the talk, you’d better walk the walk” is an idiom meaning you have to back up your claims with actions—Solis doesn’t just say he’ll take control, he gets physical and asserts his dominance.

But “flip the script” means to reverse expectations, and Solis being willing to “take a beating” in this context means he’s not afraid to take a submissive role either.

“Flip the script” also refers to the fact that Halsey gender-swapped Romeo and Juliet to create Solis and Luna.","Sittin’ on the counter in your kitchen

“Stoned ever since the days of creation” could be a historical reference to the Stone Age, one of the earliest times for mankind, named after primitive humans creating stone tools. This could tie in with the Flintstones reference from earlier.

It could also be biblical, as the “days of creation” in the Bible are the days in which God created the universe. The “been stoned” part may be a reference to John 8:7 from the Bible, which says “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her”. The verse means that you shouldn’t shame others if you aren’t perfect yourself. Phi could be referencing it to say that either he gets shunned for his drug-addicted lifestyle when it isn’t much worse than anyone else’s or it’s a reference to racism and prejudice against black communities. “I’ve been red” is a homophone for “I’ve been read” which could mean that Phi is a religious guy hence the references.

Purchasing Gucci clothing is an expensive habit, which ties back in with the theme of the song.

Ludacris spins this in two ways. Firstly, he explains that when you’re hot, and you’re relevant in the game, your money is good and your figure is good, the Gucci fits perfectly over your sculpted frame. However, when you fall off (in both a physical and metaphorical sense), your game is much less tight than it was. All of a sudden, that Gucci doesn’t physically fit, nor does it fit with your image. It becomes worthless.

He plays on the word “pockets” to mean both the pockets on your expensive clothing not working anymore, and to indicate you no longer have the bank-roll you once did.","Soon all that Gucci don’t fit, now you out of dough

“Stoned ever since the days of creation” could be a historical reference to the Stone Age, one of the earliest times for mankind, named after primitive humans creating stone tools. This could tie in with the Flintstones reference from earlier.

It could also be biblical, as the “days of creation” in the Bible are the days in which God created the universe.

","In the Netflix film Someone Great, which serves as the inspiration for this song, the protagonist’s relationship with her ex-boyfriend is shown through flashbacks, brought on by seeing different reminders of her past.

In an interview on the Elvis Duran Show, Taylor recalled how she ended up writing this song:

I cried watching the movie, and so, for, like, a week, I start waking up from dreams that I’m living out that scenario, that that’s happening to me. And I just would wake up and I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I’m writing a break-up song.’

Throughout the movie, the protagonist periodically gets drunk and high, in an effort to deal with the pain of the failed relationship.","Flashbacks waking me up

Solis and Luna’s fight is a metaphorical one, though, referring to their sexually-charged interaction. “If you talk the talk, you’d better walk the walk” is an idiom meaning you have to back up your claims with actions—Solis doesn’t just say he’ll take control, he gets physical and asserts his dominance.
