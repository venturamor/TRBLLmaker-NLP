","He is talking about how he is always high but the wordplay may actually go deeper.

“Stoned ever since the days of creation” could be a historical reference to the Stone Age, one of the earliest times for mankind, named after primitive humans creating stone tools. This could tie in with the Flintstones reference from earlier.

It could also be biblical, as the “days of creation” in the Bible are the days in which God created the universe. The “been stoned” part may be a reference to John 8:7 from the Bible, which says “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her”. The verse means that you shouldn’t shame others if you aren’t perfect yourself. Phi could be referencing it to say that either he gets shunned for his drug-addicted lifestyle when it isn’t much worse than anyone else’s or it’s a reference to racism and prejudice against black communities. “I’ve been red” is a homophone for “I’ve been read” which could mean that Phi is a religious guy hence the references.

Firstly, he explains that when you’re hot, and you’re relevant in the game, your money is good and your figure is good, the Gucci fits perfectly over your sculpted frame. However, when you fall off (in both a physical and metaphorical sense), your game is much less tight than it was. All of a sudden, that Gucci doesn’t physically fit, nor does it fit with your image.

However, when you fall off (in both a physical and metaphorical sense), your game is much less tight than it was. All of a sudden, that Gucci doesn’t physically fit, nor does it fit with your image.

“Stoned ever since the days of creation” could be a historical reference to the Stone Age, one of the earliest times for mankind, named after primitive humans creating stone tools. This could tie in with the Flintstones reference from earlier.

It could also be biblical, as the “days of creation” in the Bible are the days in which God created the universe. The “been stoned” part may be a reference to John 8:7 from the Bible, which says “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her”.

“Stoned ever since the days of creation” could be a historical reference to the Stone Age, one of the earliest times for mankind, named after primitive humans creating stone tools. This could tie in with the Flintstones reference from earlier.

It could also be biblical, as the “days of creation” in the Bible are the days in which God created the universe. The “been stoned” part may be a reference to John 8:7 from the Bible, which says “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her”. The verse means that you shouldn’t shame others if you aren’t perfect yourself. Phi could be referencing it to say that either he gets shunned for his drug-addicted lifestyle when it isn’t much worse than anyone else’s or it’s a reference to racism and prejudice against black communities. “I’ve been red” is a homophone for “I’ve been read” which could mean that Phi is a religious guy hence the references.

Purchasing Gucci clothing is an expensive habit, which ties back in with the theme of the song.

Ludacris spins this in two ways. Firstly, he explains that when you’re hot, and you’re relevant in the game, your money is good and your figure is good, the Gucci fits perfectly over your sculpted frame. However, when you fall off (in both a physical and metaphorical sense), your game is much less tight than it was. All of a sudden, that Gucci doesn’t physically fit, nor does it fit with your image. It becomes worthless.

“Stoned ever since the days of creation” could be a historical reference to the Stone Age, one of the earliest times for mankind, named after primitive humans creating stone tools. This could tie in with the Flintstones reference from earlier.

It could also be biblical, as the “days of creation” in the Bible are the days in which God created the universe. The “been stoned” part may be a reference to John 8:7 from the Bible, which says “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her”.

Purchasing Gucci clothing is an expensive habit, which ties back in with the theme of the song.

Ludacris spins this in two ways. Firstly, he explains that when you’re hot, and you’re relevant in the game, your money is good and your figure is good, the Gucci fits perfectly over your sculpted frame. However, when you fall off (in both a physical and metaphorical sense), your game is much less tight than it was. All of a sudden, that Gucci doesn’t physically fit, nor does it fit with your image. It becomes worthless.
